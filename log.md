**Thoughts**: i am really freak out today. Because i didn't code anything until 11pm. Normally i am never really freak out that reason but 100daysofcode challenge change me and i did a simple project just in one hour. i was so happy when i did a this project. Hopefully i can make a more complex and big project another days.
